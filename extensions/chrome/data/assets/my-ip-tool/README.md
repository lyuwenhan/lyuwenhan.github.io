# My IP Tool

A lightweight Chrome extension to quickly view your public IP address.

## Features
- Displays your current public IP
- Clean, minimal popup UI

## Privacy

IP lookups are performed directly between the user’s browser and a developer-controlled endpoint (https://my-ip.lyuwenhan.workers.dev) hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
No IP addresses or request data are logged or stored.

## Permissions
- Network access to a developer-controlled endpoint (https://my-ip.lyuwenhan.workers.dev) is required solely to retrieve the user’s public IP address.
